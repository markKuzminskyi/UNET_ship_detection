# UNET_ship_detection
As it follows from the project name, in this project i made UNET model for image segmentation for airbus_ship_detection challenge on Kaggle(more info about challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/airbus-ship-detection). 
I will add new files over time.

Description of every file in this project:
1. config.yml - file that have settings for training and also paths for datasets;
2. requirements.txt - file that contains requirements for this project;
3. dataset.py - file that have functions to create prepared datasets for neural network; 
4. nn_model.py - file with UNET model architecture;
5. training.py - this file contain all training and testing loops etc.;
6. inference.py - blank file, but in this file you can use trained model on your own photos.
7. utils.py - file that contains small functions, obviously;
